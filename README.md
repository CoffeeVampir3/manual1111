Make images with SDXL and stuff. Comes with two front end options:
- Gradio
- Discord Bot

Have fun.

# Install
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the installer script to get SDXL:

`python install.py`

If you're on linux and have a bunch of stable diffusion models already, you can pass -S to the installer and pass a path, it will symlink all model files found in the given path instead.

`python install.py -s "path/to/models"`

# To run:
`python ui.py`
